## Landscape and Heightmap Editing Tool and Library

[Full manual](https://github.com/Gruftikus/lltool/wiki/) under construction.

The lltool provides several methods and algorithms for heightmap manipulation and terrain triangulation. Steering of the process is done via a batch script with a small and dedicated scripting language. The terrain trinagulation is done in two steps: in a first step vertices are placed, either based on vertex placing methods, or via (a combination) of density algorithms. In second step the vertices are trinangulated and the resulting mesh can be further manipulated. lltool provides multi-level LODs, break lines and polygon stencils.
